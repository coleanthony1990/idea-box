## Overview

This application is a chance for students to build an app that displays a users custom made 'idea box'.
Idea box gives users the ability to display a custom idea onto a "card". Users also have the ability to favorite/unfavorite
cards as well as deleting cards. We have ensured that anytime the DOM is updated, the data model is updated along with it.
